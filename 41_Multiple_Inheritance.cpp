// Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from more than one classes. 
//The constructors of inherited classes are called in the same order in which they are inherited

// Eg: 
// (i) A CHILD class is derived from FATHER and MOTHER class
// (ii) A PETROL class is derived from LIQUID and FUEL class.

// Syntax:

// class A
// { 
// ... .. ... 
// };
// class B
// {
// ... .. ...
// };
// class C: public A,public B
// {
// ... ... ...
// };
